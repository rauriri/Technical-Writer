EAP Jboss documentation is pretty thorough, but it it's not easy find what you need. 

Some weeks ago, found myself in a tricky situation: I needed to deploy an application on this type of server, as soon as possible, and test it to find a bug.

Took me some time to get it done, I really missed a guide like this at the moment :)
